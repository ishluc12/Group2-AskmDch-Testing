@account
Feature: User login

  As a registered customer
  I want to login into the AskOmDch Website
  So that I can be able to access my saved information
  and be prevented from logging in when credentials are invalid


  Background:
    Given I am on the Account Page

    @Login
  Rule: Access is granted to users with valid credentials
    Scenario: Login with valid credentials
      When I log in with valid credentials
        | username | user2  |
        | password | user2! |
      Then I should be redirected to the Dashboard
      And I should see a welcome message with "user2"


  Rule: Access is denied for users with invalid credentials
    Scenario Outline: Login with invalid credentials
      When I log in with username "<username>" and password "<password>"
      Then I should see a login error message "<errorMessage>"

      Examples:
        | username | password  | errorMessage                                                                                                                    |
        | user2    | wrongPass | Error: The password you entered for the username user2 is incorrect. Lost your password?                                        |
        |          | user2!    | Error: Username is required.                                                                                                    |
        | user2    |           | Error: The password field is empty.                                                                                             |
        | unknown  | user2!    | Error: The username unknown is not registered on this site. If you are unsure of your username, try your email address instead. |
